Problem Statement
We aim to improve legal document retrieval in the context of patent law by integrating domain-specific terminology extraction with semantic information retrieval (IR). Our system will extract key technical terms from patent documents and use them to enhance retrieval of related prior patents via embedding-based search. Practically, if effective, this tool can cut down on time needed for the prior art search process of patent prosecution.
Evaluation Plan
Task: Given a patent (query), retrieve relevant prior patents from a corpus in the form of a probability ranking (similar to the IR homework)
Approach:
Build three systems
Baseline 1: TF-IDF / BM25 keyword search
Baseline 2: Embedding-based retrieval on full abstracts
Ours: Embedding-based retrieval using extracted key terms or abstract+terms
Evaluation Metric:
Recall: Check if known citations (prior patents cited in the query patent) appear in the top K retrieved documents
Precision, MAP
Error Analysis: For a few query patents, manually inspect and explain successes or failures
Corpus Split:
~1000–2000 patents from a specific technology domain
Use train/dev/test split, ensuring test patents have citation metadata
Optionally simulate queries using newer patents and evaluate on known references

This paper describes the application and modification of the Termolator for use with Legal Terminology and directly informs the terminology extraction component of our system. It adapts the Termolator, a high-performing terminology extractor originally tuned for scientific texts, to U.S. Supreme Court decisions. The authors introduce legal-specific filters like removing case names and statutes and redefine relevance scoring using a legal corpus. We will likely employ similar methods when building our term extraction system specifically tuned towards patents and IP.

This paper presents a survey of traditional and modern approaches to patent information retrieval, including term-based methods (TF-IDF, BM25), NLP techniques (POS tagging, phrase extraction), and recent embedding-based models like PatentSBERTa. The paper provides possible complementary/competing methodologies as well as more sources to follow up with.

This paper investigates automating prior-art search by comparing full patent texts rather than crafting keyword queries. They vectorize documents with several representations, tf-idf bag-of-words, LSA, kernel PCA, word2vec, and doc2vec, and rank candidates via cosine similarity. Across evaluations, full-text similarity (notably tf-idf and learned embeddings) yields higher recall and better retrieval quality than traditional keyword search, demonstrating that strong, query-free baselines exist for prior-art discovery without preliminary term extraction. This is a competing methodology.

Marín Pérez and Rea Rizzo compare two automatic term recognition (ATR) methods, Chung’s ratio-based approach and Scott’s Keywords tool from WordSmith 5.0, on a 2.6 million-word legal English corpus. Using a 10,000-entry legal glossary for validation, they measure precision and recall against a general English reference corpus. Results show that Keywords performs substantially better (62% precision, 31% recall) than Chung’s method, which suffers from high noise. The authors conclude that automatic methods can efficiently identify legal terminology, though expert input remains necessary for nuanced cases. This paper can be used to inform our development of a legal terminology extraction pipeline for patents, where we can draw on the methodologies discussed in this paper.
Suzuki, S. (2016). Extraction of Keywords of Novelties From Patent Claims (pp. 1192–1200). https://aclanthology.org/C16-1113.pdf
This paper proposes an NLP-based method for automatically extracting keywords of novelties, terms reflecting the inventive aspects of patents, from patent claims. Unlike prior approaches such as BM25, CRF, or TextRank, which focus on general keyword relevance or named entity extraction, their method leverages the hierarchical structure of patent claims, assuming that novel terms appear in elements referenced by dependent claims or in lower structural levels. The algorithm decomposes claims into elements, identifies inter-element and inter-claim dependencies, and computes novelty scores for candidate keywords based on locality and dependency depth. This directly informs our legal terminology extraction component. We can adapt their idea of novelty-weighted term importance to prioritize the most innovative or distinctive technical terms within patents.

This paper investigates the vocabulary of modern patent language from the perspective of English for Specific Purposes (ESP). They argue that patent writing is a specialised genre (especially in the context of intellectual property rights and globalization), yet there are relatively few corpus-based studies on its lexical features. Their findings motivate the domain adaptation aspect of our system. Since patent language diverges sharply from both legal and scientific prose, our terminology extractor and embedding model must be tuned to this genre. Insights from their corpus analysis can guide feature selection (e.g., multi-word legal expressions) and inform preprocessing rules to improve precision in extracting legally salient terminology
Strategy for Solving the Problem
Terminology Extraction (custom-built):
POS-tagging + regex rules to extract candidate noun phrases
Frequency-based scoring (e.g., TF-IDF, weirdness, log-likelihood)
Heuristics to prioritize multi-word technical/legal expressions
Embedding IR System (using existing model):
Use PatentSBERTa or similar pretrained sentence encoder
Encode query and corpus documents (full abstract or extracted terms)
Perform nearest-neighbor search (cosine similarity) with Scikit-learn
Evaluation Pipeline:
Extract ground truth citations from patent metadata
Compute recall and precision over the test set
Baseline Comparisons:
TF-IDF or BM25 lexical retrieval
Pure embedding search with no term extraction
Collaboration Plan
Each member will own a component: extraction, retrieval, evaluation, or presentation.
We will define input/output formats (e.g., JSON or TSV) early to allow pipeline development in parallel.
Regular progress check-ins twice a week outside of mentor meetings.
Shared GitHub repository with version control and documentation.
